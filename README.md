Regression with a Mohs Hardness Dataset

This repository is an attempt to predict the Mohs hardness of a mineral based off of it's properties. The Mohs hardness scale measures a mineral's resistance to scratching.

## Overview
### What is the challenge?  
Build a model to predict the hardness of unidentified minerals, the only qualities known are provided  
### My approach
Building two regression models, comparing performance and choosing best model to make predictions
### Performance
